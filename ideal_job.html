        <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/67744754?type=standout#sol=d5245f837bdd9aff414eaadb284cfaa2eaca68dd">UX/UI Designer</a></p>

        <h2>Position Description</h2>
        <p>This job involves working as a UX/UI Designer, a key role within the Design & Experience team. The primary responsibilities include maintaining and improving the company's Design System, and leading a variety of design projects relating to our digital assets like the website, e-commerce platform, and app. This role is at the intersection of Product, CX, and Technology functions, and is of great significance due to the company's wide array of products and services. The position is suitable for a mid-level designer who has some experience in UX/UI, and is particularly appealing to me because of the opportunity to learn more about UX.</p>

        <h2>Required Skills, Qualifications and Experience</h2>
        <p>The position requires someone with 2-3 years of UX/UI experience, with an emphasis on UI. Other necessary skills include managing and developing a design system, coordinating the auditing and enhancement of digital experiences, and collaborating with other team members to generate ideas and design interfaces. A strong knowledge of UX/UI best practices is essential, including Apple HIG (Human Interface Guidelines), Google Material Design, and WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). The ability to create concept wireframes, detailed designs and exceptional experiences is also crucial for this role.</p>

        <h2>Current Skills, Qualifications and Experience</h2>
        <p>I have some experience in UX/UI design, having worked on several small projects and completing the digital design subject at Curtin University. I also have an understanding of design systems and a strong proficiency in programming. While I have not yet gained the requisite years of UX/UI experience, I have a good foundation of skills that could be built upon.</p>

        <h2>Plan to Acquire Necessary Skills, Qualifications and Experience</h2>
        <p>To gain the skills required for this position, I plan to complete further courses in UX/UI design to deepen my understanding and develop my skills. To improve my knowledge of design systems, I will personally study industry standards such as Apple HIG, Google Material Design, and WCAG, and practice applying them in my own projects.</p>
