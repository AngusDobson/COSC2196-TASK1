        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
        
        <p>From a young age, I had a strong interest in IT, which started when I began pulling apart computers and
            putting them back together to learn how they worked. This interest led me to teach myself different
            programming languages, and I started to create several websites, game mods, and applications.</p>

        <p>I started my professional IT journey in 2015, after graduating from high school and enrolling in on-campus
            studies at UQ. Not long after starting my course, I was offered a full-time job by a previous employer in
            the managed service provider field. During my six years there, I moved from a customer service consultant
            role, where I was mainly answering phones, to becoming a Level 2 Technician. I became the escalation point
            many others in the company would go to when they needed help. In the last year, I've moved to a new company
            but I'm still working in a similar role.</p>

        <p>I decided to come to RMIT to finish the degree I started in 2015. The main reason I chose RMIT was the
            flexibility it offered, as I could complete my degree while working full-time, without the need to travel to
            a campus for classes.</p>

        <p>So far, my studies have taught me a lot, especially in the areas of security and programming. I've enjoyed
            learning languages like Java and C++, even though C++ has been challenging.</p>
