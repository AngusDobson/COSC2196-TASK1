        <img id="dinnerizerLogo" src="images/logo-no-background.png">

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>"Dinnerizer" will be a desktop application that offers a streamlined approach to weekly meal planning and
            grocery shopping. The app will present a variety of dinner options based on the user's preferences, dietary
            restrictions, and chosen cuisine styles. It will also generate a detailed list of recipes for each chosen
            meal and compile an organized shopping list for user convenience. The primary goal of Dinnerizer is to
            mitigate the stress of daily dinner decision-making, encourage diversity in meals, and ultimately, foster an
            enjoyable cooking experience.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The conception of Dinnerizer comes from the daily dilemma faced by many - deciding what to cook for dinner.
            Often, this indecisiveness leads to repetitive meal choices or reliance on unhealthy takeaway options.
            Mismanaged grocery shopping can also lead to food waste or unnecessary multiple shopping trips. Dinnerizer
            will address these challenges by offering varied meal suggestions and compiling an efficient shopping list,
            thus promoting home cooking and healthier dietary habits. Its potential impact on daily life and eating
            habits is significant, making this project a valuable contribution to the digital tools aimed at improving
            lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dinnerizer is an application designed with the goal of making weekly meal planning intuitive, efficient, and
            enjoyable for users. The core of the application lies in its extensive recipe database, comprising an array
            of dishes that span various cuisine types, dietary requirements, and preparation times. This breadth of
            options ensures users can exercise maximum customization in their meal planning process, aligning it with
            their individual dietary preferences and lifestyles.</p>

        <p>The user experience begins the moment the application is launched. The user interface is designed for
            simplicity, with clear directions guiding users through their first meal planning session. The process
            starts by collecting key information from users, including the number of meals they wish to plan for the
            week, the desired cuisine type, and specific dietary restrictions or preferences. For instance, if a user
            intends to plan seven meals consisting solely of vegetarian options, they can simply input these details and
            Dinnerizer will generate a list of seven vegetarian dinner ideas. The application goes further to
            accommodate detailed dietary nuances such as low-carb, gluten-free, or dairy-free choices.</p>

        <p>Each meal suggested by Dinnerizer is accompanied by a detailed recipe card. These cards are designed to
            provide comprehensive culinary guidance and include an ingredient list with precise quantities, step-by-step
            cooking instructions, and a visually appealing photograph of the completed dish. This presentation enables
            users to anticipate the outcome and plan their cooking process more effectively. To enhance the user's
            interaction with these recipes, Dinnerizer includes a 'favourites' feature. This allows users to save
            recipes they enjoyed or wish to try, offering quick and easy access for future meal planning sessions.</p>

        <p>One of the standout features of Dinnerizer is its capacity to generate an efficient shopping list based on
            the selected meals for the week. The application intelligently aggregates all the necessary ingredients and
            sorts them into categories such as dairy, produce, and grains. This categorization aims to streamline the
            shopping experience, reducing the time spent searching for items and avoiding repeated trips down the same
            aisle. Before this list is finalised, users have the opportunity to review it and check off ingredients
            already available in their pantry, thereby avoiding unnecessary purchases and reducing food waste. Once
            finalised, this list can be exported in a printable format or emailed directly to the user for easy access
            during shopping.</p>

        <p>Dinnerizer also acknowledges and caters to the adventurous eaters with the 'Surprise Me' feature. This
            exciting option randomly selects recipes from the database, encouraging users to try new dishes and explore
            varied cuisine styles. This feature promotes culinary diversity and adds an element of surprise to the
            otherwise routine meal planning process.</p>

        <p>As Dinnerizer evolves, the roadmap includes potential enhancements aimed at increasing user convenience. One
            such improvement is integrating the application with local supermarket online platforms such as Coles or
            Woolworths. This feature would
            allow users to directly order their shopping list through the application, minimizing the time and effort
            spent on physical shopping trips. This advancement would mark Dinnerizer not just as a meal planning tool,
            but a comprehensive meal management solution, further simplifying and enriching the home-cooking experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>The Dinnerizer application will be constructed using Java due to its wide-ranging libraries and
            cross-platform capabilities. JavaFX will be utilised for crafting a user-friendly interface. Local text
            files will serve as data storage for recipes, user preferences, and other data, instead of a traditional
            database. Java's built-in I/O libraries will facilitate reading from and writing to these text files.
            Additional libraries may be explored to facilitate exporting shopping lists, either as printable PDFs or
            directly sent to users' emails.</p>

        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        <p>Building Dinnerizer will require proficiency in Java programming and experience with JavaFX for GUI design.
            Skills in file handling in Java, particularly reading from and writing to text files, will be essential.
            Understanding of good user interface design principles will be beneficial in creating an intuitive and
            user-friendly application. An ability to conduct user testing, respond to feedback, and iteratively improve
            the application will be crucial to its successful development and eventual reception among users.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>Upon completion, Dinnerizer will be a valuable tool assisting in meal planning and providing a structured
            approach to grocery shopping. By alleviating decision fatigue, Dinnerizer will facilitate a diverse range of
            meals, promoting healthier home-cooked diets. Efficient grocery shopping could also mean less waste and
            cost-saving. This application is designed to encourage a healthy, sustainable lifestyle by making
            home-cooking more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable. While Dinnerizer's primary function is practical,
            its potential impact on improving users' lifestyle is substantial.</p>
